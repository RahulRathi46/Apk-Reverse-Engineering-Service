A tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It also makes working with an app easier because of the project like file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc.

It is NOT intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing, adding some features or support for custom platforms, analyzing applications and much more.

Motivation for this project is when i faced the similer problem while devloping a app that needs a feature but i don't have an idea what that is called and how to make that feature in my app. While searching web i come across the some webserivices that allows Reverse-Engineering and it stick with me what goes in backend to deploy this kind of service.
